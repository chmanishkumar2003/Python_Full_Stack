1)What are *functions* in Python? Difference between \*args and \*\*kwargs?
-> A function is a block of reusable code that performs a specific code.
-> when we want to rewrite the whole code you can define it with a function after you can call it if needed. 
 No need to rewrite the whole code, just call the function it will be executed.
eg: def function_name():
    	add=20+30
 	return add 
    print(function_name())
-> functions helps in reusability, readability, and modularity.
Difference between args and kwargs: Both are used in function definitions when you don't know in advance how many arguments or parameters will be passed.
->*args:(Arbitrary Positional Arguments)
  -it collects extra positional arguments as tuple, use it when you want to pass a variable number of arguments.
eg: def add_numbers(*args):
    	return sum(args)
    print(add_numbers(1,2,3)) #it prints 6
->**kwargs:(Arbitrary keyword argument)
  -it collects extra keyword arguments as dictionary, use when you want to handle arguments that you dont know
    in advance
eg: def print_details(**kwargs):
    	for key, value in kwargs.items():
		print(f"{key}:{value}")
    print(print_details(name="harish",age=21))

2)Explain **decorators** in Python with an example.
->A decorator is a function it used another function as input, adds some functionality to it, and returns a new function as it called wrapper, it is used in extra code without modifying or changing the original source code.
->wrap: it is a function used for extra behaviour.
->the decorators are used mainly for add logging, to check authentication, to measure execution time, to modify or 
  extend function behaviour without rewriting it
eg1:def my_decorator(fun):
    def wrapper():
        print("before the function runs")
        fun()
        print("After the function run")
    return wrapper
@my_decorator   #this is the decorator to hello()
def hello():
    print("Helo world!")
hello() 

eg2:#decorator with argument
def smart_division(fun):
    def wrapper(a,b):
        print(f'Division {a} by {b}')
        if b==0:
            return "Error!, Division by zero"
        return fun(a,b)
    return wrapper
@smart_division
def division(a,b):
    return a/b
print(division(5,0))
print(division(10,5))

3)What are generators and yield?
->A generator is a special type function that allows you to create an iterator(something you can loop over)
  in a simple and memory efficient way.
->Instead of returning of all values at once(like a list), a generator yield values at a time, only when needed.
->Yield: Yield is like return or print, but it pause the function instead of end the function.
  When the function is called again, it resumes where it left off.
eg: def my_generator():
	yield 1
	yield 2
	yield 3

   gen= my_generator()
   
print(next(gen))  #1
print(next(gen))   #2
print(next(gen))    #3

if you print again it will raise StopIteration
eg2: def countdown(n):
	while n>0:                    #output
   	   yield n                     5
	   n=n-1			4
     for num in countdown(5):		3
	print(num)                      2
					1
4)Difference between iterable, iterator, and generator?
->Iterable: An iterable is a pyhtonn object we can loop over with using for loop.
  It implements the iter method
eg: text="python"	
    for char in text:	
	print(char)     #here string Python is an iterable, because we can loop over it.
->Iterator: We can turn an iterable to iterator using iter() method.
            By this we can fetch items one by one using next()
eg:numbers[1,2,3]      #here numbers are iterable
  item=iter(numbers)   #here item is an iterator
  print(next(item))  #1
  print(next(item))  #2
  print(next(item))  #3
  print(next(item))  #it will show Stopiteration 
->Generator: It is function created with yield and generators are iterators
   eg:def countdowm(n):
         while n>0:
           yield n
           n=n-1
      for num in countdown(5):
     	print(num)           #it will print reverse order in numbers like 5,4,3,2,1

5)Explain **list comprehension** with an example.?
->List comprehension is a way of writing code in short and elegant to create lists in python.
  Instead of writing a for loop and appending values, we can write it in one line.

 eg: without list comprehension         with list comprehension
        num=[]					num=[i*i for i in range(5)]
        for i in range(5):			print(num)
	    num.append(i*i)
        print(num)                       output: [0,1,4,9,16]

6) What is the difference between **classmethod, staticmethod, and instance method**?
->Instance method
  An instance method is a function defined in a class that operates on a instance object  of the class.
  It takes self as the first parameter, which represents the object itself.
eg: class Student:
    def __init__(self, name, marks):
        self.name = name       # instance variable
        self.marks = marks     # instance variable
    # Instance method
    def display_info(self):
        print(f"Name: {self.name}, Marks: {self.marks}")
# Creating objects (instances)
s1 = Student("Harish", 90)
s2 = Student("Anu", 85)
# Calling instance methods
s1.display_info()   # Output: Name: Harish, Marks: 90
s2.display_info()   # Output: Name: Anu, Marks: 85

->static method: Static method does not depends on the self and class itself. in decorators we use @staticmethod
eg: class Validator:
    @staticmethod
    def is_even(num):
        return num % 2 == 0

print(Validator.is_even(10))  # True
print(Validator.is_even(7))   # False

->A class method is a method that works on the class itself, not on the self(instances).
  It takes cls(class) as the first parameter instead of self(instance) and we should use in decorators as
    @classmethod
eg: class Student:
        school="Gitam University"
        @classmethod
        def get_school(cls):
            return cls.school
--->Example all three
class Student:
    school="Gitam University"
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name=name        #instance variable
        self.age=age          #instance variable
    
    #instance method
    def show_details(self):
        return f'name:{self.name},age:{self.age}'
    
    #static method
    @staticmethod
    def add(a,b):
        return a+b
    
    #class method
    @classmethod
    def get_school(cls):     #here get_school is a class method
        return cls.school    #here cls.school is a class variable
    
#How to use them
s1=Student("Harish",21)      #(instance)
print(s1.show_details())                           #output:name:Harish,age:21
#using static method
print(Student.add(5,5))                            #output:10
#using class method
print(Student.get_school())                        #output:Gitam University

7)Explain **Python’s OOP concepts**: inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, abstraction?

-->Inheritance: One class(child) can inherit properties and methods from another class(Parent). This promotes code reuse.
eg:class Animal:  # Parent class
    def speak(self):
        return "I make sounds"

   class Dog(Animal):  # Child class inherits Animal
      def speak(self):   # Overriding
         return "Woof!"
   class Cat(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        return "Meow!"
 dog = Dog()
 cat= Cat()
 print(dog.speak())        #woof!
 print(cat.speak())        # Meow!
-->Polymorphism: Same method name can behaves differently depending on the object. One name, many forms.
eg: animals = [Dog(), Cat()]
    for animal in animals:        #here Both Dog and Cat use the same method speak(), but output differs.
       print(animal.speak())     # output: Dog → Woof!, Cat → Meow!
-->Encapsulation: Binding the data and functions into a single entity. Restrict direct access to some attributes/methods to protect data
eg: class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self, balance):
        self.__balance = balance   # private attribute
    def deposit(self, amount):
        self.__balance += amount
    def get_balance(self):
        return self.__balance
acc = BankAccount(1000)
acc.deposit(500)
print(acc.get_balance())  # output: 1500
# print(acc.__balance) ❌ AttributeError
-->Abstraction: Hiding the implementation details and exposing only the essential features

8)What are **magic/dunder methods** in Python? Give examples (__str__, __init__)?
-->Dunder=Double Underscore eg->__int__, __str__.
  These are special methods in python that start and end with __.
  we dont need to call directly. Python calls them automatically when you do certain things.
eg:with __init__, __str__
  class Student:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
       self.name=name
       self.age=age
    def __str__(self):            #double underscore is called dunder which is starting and ending of the function name
       return f'Name:{self.name}, Age:{self.age}'
  s1=Student("Harish",21)
  print(s1)                 

9) Explain **Python’s Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)**. Why is it important?
-->GIL ensures that only one thread runs pyhton bytecode at a time, even on multi-core processors.
eg:Imagine you have a classroom(CPU) with many students(threads) but only one pen(GIL).
   Even through multiple students want to write on the board at the same time, only one can use the pen at a time.
-->Why does Python have the GIL:Simple memory management- Python uses references counting to manage objects in memory.
  So, the GIL prevents multiple threads from changing reference counts at the same time(avoid crashes).
   --Good for single threaded programs-Simple safer memory management.
   --multi programs running at a same time even in the multi-processor we cant use them in parallel because of the GIL.

10) Difference between **deepcopy vs copy.copy()** in Python?
-->copy.copy is shallow copy in python- Both uses reference data objects but
  -In the shallow copy when we modify the reference object data in the original object of data can also changed.
  -In the deepcopy when we modify the reference object data in the original object of data cannot be changed.
eg:#shallow copy
import copy
original=[[1,2],[3,4]]
shallow_copy=copy.cop(original)
shallow_copy[0][1]=99
print(original)           #[[1,99],[3,4]]    here the original also changed in shallow_copy
print(shallow_copy)       #[[1,99],[3,4]]

eg:deepcopy
import copy
original=[[1,2],[3,4]]
deep_copy=copy.deepcopy(original)
deep_copy[0][1]=100
print(original)          #[[1,2],[3,4]]     here the original is not changed when you changed the reference
print(deep_copy)         #[[1,100],[3,4]]
